# Emotion Tracker

> What am I trying to accomplish?

My thought is to have an app that will ask you how you felt today. This prompt will come to you automatically at a time that you set. The prompt will appear as a list of emoji's that you can choose from. After you select the emoji, there will appear a place where you can record three things that you are grateful for (or a place where you can do a voice recording. These things will be saved to a database. The idea is that you can then login in see your past emotions and hopefully, after recording things you are grateful for, you are able to see an upward trend.

There are a couple other things that I think would enhance the experience.

1.  After you select an emotion, have a bar where you can rate it on a scale of 1-10.
2.  Also subscribe to a service, that provides short messages, articles or videos. (ie, LDS messages or Medium)
3.  After you write your answers/recording, you can then save it to our DB or save copies to you local machine
4.  With the past data that has been submitted, it would be good to have a visual representation of past emotions along with a compilation of entries.


> What programs will I utilize?

* App - React
* Api - Hapi
* DB  - Firebase? Perhaps, rethinkDB.

>Features that would be needed?

A login
A couple of different screens:
*  Home page
*  Graphical Representation of past emotions
*  Compilation of entries with a customizable timeline
*  About page
*  A bot? A service that will send a reminder to a phone through SMS, bot, or other service. It will have to be automated based on a timer that is set by the individual.
*  A recommendations/feedback page

> Who would be the target audience?

Everyone, distributed through links to FB, Instagram, etc.

> How could money be made?

Advertising (possibly), premium services? An upfront purchase price if they want us to save their data to a database.
